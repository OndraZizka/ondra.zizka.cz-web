                         ********** Introduction **********

            Miner is a game of rare earths mining.  In the game, you
            assume the role of a miner in search of rare earths like
            silver, gold, and platinum.

            The game was originally implemented on a Commodore Pet
            computer in the late 70's as a text only style game.  The
            current version encompasses more than the original version,
            but much of the charm remains intact.  I wrote and released
            another PC miner game (text only) several years back.  That
            earlier version was primitive and bears little resemblance
            to the current (hopefully better) one.  For this version I
            started from scratch in a different language and used only
            VGA screen modes.  My personal goal with this program was to
            gain experience working with the graphics technology of the
            VGA card.

            I would be very interested in locating the original
            programmer of the Commodore version if anyone has any clues.



                     ********** MinerVGA Distribution **********

            MinerVGA is distributed as public domain software.  You may
            freely copy and distribute MinerVGA provided you receive no
            compensation for doing so.  There are no fees, licenses, or
            other BS.  Personally, I hate those companies that take PD
            software and sell them to you with a charge on the diskette
            that the software is contained on.  It defeats the purpose
            of releasing the software as PD.

            Anyway, the games consists of four files:

                           MINERVGA.EXE  the game executable file
                           MINERVGA.LBR  the sprite library
                           MINERVGA.DOC  this document file
                           MINERVGA.SAV  the save game file
                           MINERVGA.SCR  the high score file

            Source code may be available.  It depends on the demand.  I
            will likely include source listings in future releases.  If
            you are desperate for source code, leave a message to me on
            the Walnut Creek Auntie BBS at (415) 937-0156 Harrell Stiles

            MinerVGA was written in MS Quick Basic 4.0.



                **********Graphics Modes and Compatibility **********

            MinerVGA uses only graphics mode twelve (12).  The
            resolution is 640x480 with 16 colors (text 80x30).  It is a
            standard VGA video mode, and some EGA cards may support it
            as well.  I don't know if MCGA supports this mode, but you
            might try.  The code was written on and for VGA compatible
            displays.  In my opinion there are too few recreational
            programs for these machines when this should be one of their
            strong suits.



                    ********** The Object and Winning **********

            The object of the game is to "make a lady" out of Miss Mimi,
            the owner of the brothel.  If this sounds too sexist for
            you, you might want to quit reading now and not play.

            In essence, she has agreed to marry you IF you present her
            with a diamond ring and $20,000 in cash (your mutual
            retirement fund.)

            "Anything less and I would be wasting my god given talents
            on just one man.", says she.  Because of her history of
            unsanitary sexual practices you may also want to consider
            having a condom as well.

            You win the game when you present yourself to Miss Mimi with
            $20,000 and a diamond ring.  The toughest part, of course,
            is mining enough ore to come up with the $20,000.




                           ********** Key Help **********

            You control your miner with the keyboard.  The arrow keys
            move the miner in up to 4 directions (diagonal movement is
            not allowed.)  Other keys are as follows:

                 H    Help, brings up a help screen with keystroke
                      commands, suggestions, etc.

                 X    eXit, ends the game.  No Save, No Query, It's
                      over.  Useful if the boss comes around the corner,
                      if you have saved recently.

                 S    Save, saves the game to MINERVGA.SAV and ends the
                      game.

                 R    Restore, restores a previously saved game from
                      MINERVGA.SAV

                 Q    Quiet!, silences the program.  Note: if you win
                      the game, you will still hear the song at the end,
                      even if silenced.

                 E    Enter, used to enter buildings.  Works only in
                      town.  You must move to the space in front of the
                      door you want to enter.

                 T    Top, when used in the elevator, takes you to the
                      top of the shaft.  Otherwise, has no effect.

                 B    Bottom, when used in the elevator, takes you to
                      the maximum depth available to you.  Otherwise,
                      has no effect.

                 D    Drill, allows you to remove granite from the mine
                      by drilling it out.  You must have a drill to do
                      this.

                 P    Pump, allows you to remove water from the mine by
                      pumping it out.  A bucket is required.  A pump
                      will decrease the cost of this.

                 Y    dYnamite, will initiate a dynamite blast sequence.
                      you need dynamite and a torch.




             ********** The Mine, the Town, and the Elevator **********

            The game is in 2 dimensions, limiting you to up and down and
            left and right.  You move through the town, the mine, and
            the elevator in the same fashion.

            You have secured the mineral rights for an oddly shaped
            section of earth.  The dimensions of the mine are
            approximately 240' wide by 960' deep.

            The town lies over the top of the mine, separated by an
            impassable ground water barrier that keeps the buildings
            from falling into your mine.  The barrier is impervious to
            all but the most powerful of tools.

            The Elevator shaft is on the far right of your mine and
            actually is the rightmost limit to your mining area.  The
            elevator is your only means of transportation between the
            mine and the town.  It remains in the shaft and will only
            move when you are in it.  You cannot enter the shaft at any
            point except where the elevator is.

            At the start of the game the elevator has a maximum depth
            that is less than the maximum depth of the mine.  You can
            spend money to increase your elevator's maximum depth in
            increments of 60' until you have reached the bottom.  Extra
            depth is purchased in the general store.



                    ********** Health and the Hospital **********

            During the course of your underground adventures, you will
            find there are hazards to your health - cave ins,
            underground springs, etc.

            Health is represented in the game as a percentage of total
            health.  Although it is possible to go above %100, this is
            rare.  Generally, your health will range from zero to one
            hundred.  When your health goes below %20, it will turn red
            in an effort to attract your attention to your failing
            condition.

            If your health falls below zero you are dead and the game is
            over.  Health can be recovered through surgery and bed rest
            at the hospital.  For a price, of course.




                      ********** Money and the Bank **********

            You have available to you at the start of the game a bank
            account of $1500.  It is necessary to outfit yourself with
            proper mining equipment, etc..  You must remember that
            mining is not cheap and you will incur costs every time you
            venture into the mine to explore the depths.  If you run out
            of money, the bank will spot you a very little bit, but
            whenever your account is below 0, you run the risk of
            immediately losing the game.

            The bank is also the assay office, and you can exchange any
            minerals you have found for a credit to your account.



                    ********** Equipment and the Store **********

            Equipment is not necessary to play the game.  It is probably
            necessary if you want to win, however.  Pieces of equipment
            fall into three categories: items that help you mine by
            giving you abilities, items that are necessary in order to
            do special mining tasks, and all others which generally have
            some special use.

            Digging implements like a shovel or pick will decrease the
            basic cost of mining.  Their benefit is cumulative, having
            two is better than one.

            Light sources increase your chance to locate minerals and
            hazards before you walk right into them.  Lanterns and
            torches are good for this.  Periodically, a light source
            object might get used up and need to be replaced.  Lanterns
            last longer then torches.  The clover will improve your
            luck.

            The drill is necessary to drill granite.  The bucket is
            necessary to pump water (the pump reduces the cost of this,
            but is not necessary.)

            Both the dynamite and the torch are necessary to make an
            explosion.  Special Note: Make sure you have a path directly
            to your right to run away to or you will be caught in the
            blast and suffer grievously.

            Equipment can be purchased at the store.  You cannot have
            more than one of a given item at a time.  There are several
            items that cannot be bought.  They must be found, stolen, or
            built.  There are a total of 12 items available in the game,
            each with some unique property.



                       ********** Miss Mimi's Place **********

            The saloon/brothel can supply you with beer, food, condoms,
            and women.  More importantly, it is where you can evaluate
            your progress in the game.

            The saloon is closed for the first part of the game, and
            Mimi is unavailable until you have a certain amount of
            money.  Visiting Mimi with the proper amount of money and
            the ring wins the game.

            Food and drink are not required to play the game.  Like the
            outhouse, they simply add color.  The "night to remember"
            option is useful because the working girls often have hints
            and suggestions.
