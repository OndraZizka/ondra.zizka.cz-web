JUnitDiff - JUnit diff - test results reports comparison
********************************************************

Compares several JUnit reports and creates a comparison table.
Curently quite simple, more to be done.


Usage
=====

1) Create the XML file aggregated from several JUnit test runs.

      /--code bash .[brush:]
      java -jar JUnitDiff.jar ( dir | TEST-foo.xml | report-paths-list.txt )+
      \--


2) Transform the resulting XML file to HTML

      /--code bash .[brush:]
      ./transformToHTML.sh AGG-TEST.xml
      \--



Result
======

A table like this:

|* Test name           |* report 1 |* report 2 |* report 3 |* report 4 |
| "Known issues .{font-size:75%}":[javascript:alert('This will show known issues for this test.')] org.jboss.qa.Test1  | OK       .{color:green}| FAIL     .{color:red}  | OK       .{color:green}| OK       .{color:green}|
| "Known issues .{font-size:75%}":[javascript:alert('This will show known issues for this test.')] org.jboss.qa.Test2  | FAIL       .{color:red}| OK       .{color:green}|          .{color:green}| OK       .{color:green}|
| "Known issues .{font-size:75%}":[javascript:alert('This will show known issues for this test.')] org.jboss.qa.Test3  | OK       .{color:green}| FAIL     .{color:red}  | OK       .{color:green}| OK       .{color:green}|
| "Known issues .{font-size:75%}":[javascript:alert('This will show known issues for this test.')] org.jboss.qa.Test4  |          .{color:green}| FAIL     .{color:red}  | FAIL     .{color:red}  | OK       .{color:green}|

Also, the FAILed tests will link to the most probable known issue causing the failure.

    This is rather for continuous build & integration. I need to grab a few .xml files and have a result, in one step.
